# Challenge Name
Untangaling Users: Users becoming root with su

## My solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{ULzYOV3nS9EipZ_F4Da_r0z4kEl.QX1UDN1wCN3gjNzEzW}`

I first did `su` so as to enter the root after which I cat the flag to read it's content and got the flag.
```bash
hacker@users~becoming-root-with-su:~$ su
Password: 
root@users~becoming-root-with-su:/home/hacker# cat /flag
pwn.college{ULzYOV3nS9EipZ_F4Da_r0z4kEl.QX1UDN1wCN3gjNzEzW}
```
