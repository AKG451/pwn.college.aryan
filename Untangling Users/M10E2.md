# Challenge Name
Untangaling Users: Other users with su

## My solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{w4Kc9WeUM6CFdBJemD17bJsKC3l.QX2UDN1wCN3gjNzEzW}`

I simply used su command with zardus as the argument to get the final flag. I simply had to enter the password for zardus user to get into his terminal and eventually run `/challenge/run` command to get the flag.
```bash
hacker@users~other-users-with-su:~$ su zardus
Password: 
zardus@users~other-users-with-su:/home/hacker$ /challenge/run
Congratulations, you have become Zardus! Here is your flag:
pwn.college{w4Kc9WeUM6CFdBJemD17bJsKC3l.QX2UDN1wCN3gjNzEzW}
```
