# Challenge Name
Digesting Documents: Learning from documentation

## My solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{YLHrvwTFDB-3MJZa87kIfdH262a.QX0ITO0wCN3gjNzEzW}`

We were told to run `/challenge/challenge` as the command along with argument `--giveflag`
So in the linux terminal i entered the the follwing command and argument to get the flag.
We had learnt about command and argument in previous modules hence this exercise wasn't very tough and i solved it in the first attempt itself.
```bash
hacker@man~learning-from-documentation:~$ /challenge/challenge --giveflag
Correct argument! Here is your flag:
pwn.college{YLHrvwTFDB-3MJZa87kIfdH262a.QX0ITO0wCN3gjNzEzW}
```

## What I learned
I learnt that every documentation has a apropriate way in which we should run it or else it won't run properly.
