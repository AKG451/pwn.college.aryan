# Challenge Name
Digesting Documents: Searching for manuals

## My solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{YMT5Wx4bUkI1pFYyzdnDDjbtP-n.QX1EDO0wCN3gjNzEzW}`

First i ran the man man command to figure out the command to run next. AFter reading i learnt about two commands i.e `-k and apropos` both of them work similarly. I went with `-k` command since it felt cleaner and ran it with challenge argument since in the question it was mentioned. After run that i got to know  about savabxkxmu argument which i ran man again to read how to use and after figuring out how to use it I ran the final command to get the flag finally. I took the help of Gemini AI for learning the usage of `-k and apropos` commands since i couldn't understand it well just by reading the manual.
```bash
hacker@man~searching-for-manuals:~$ man man
hacker@man~searching-for-manuals:~$ man -k challenge
savabxkxmu (1)       - print the flag!
hacker@man~searching-for-manuals:~$ man savabxkxmu
hacker@man~searching-for-manuals:~$ /challenge/challenge --savabx 217
Correct usage! Your flag: pwn.college{sN2_1FaSYvDaYJbSxAL7kXxmMOu.QX2EDO0wCN3gjNzEzW}
```

## What I learned
I learnt that we can use `man man` to understand all the commands and arguments related to man feature.
