# Challenge Name
Digesting Documents: Learning from documentation

## My solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{EgxbkbfBA1Yz3vRvkgKb0v-OnH6.QX0EDO0wCN3gjNzEzW}`

We were told to run `man challenge` to get the details about the argument to run to get the flag.I did that and in the manual i saw that is i run `--gxbkbf NUM` argument with 130 instead of NUM then the flag will get printed.
```bash
hacker@man~reading-manuals:~$ man challenge
hacker@man~reading-manuals:~$ /challenge/challenge --gxbkbf 130
Correct usage! Your flag: pwn.college{EgxbkbfBA1Yz3vRvkgKb0v-OnH6.QX0EDO0wCN3gjNzEzW}
```

## What I learned
I learnt that ewe can use man along with a command to get an idea of how to use that particular command. We have to press q to quit the manual page.
