# Challenge Name
Digesting Documents: Learning from documentation

## My solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{YMT5Wx4bUkI1pFYyzdnDDjbtP-n.QX1EDO0wCN3gjNzEzW}`

We were told to run `man challenge` to get the details about the argument to run to get the flag.I did that and in the manual i had to use the / to search in the manual. What is did is `/flag` this told me the the argument that had the flag.
```bash
hacker@man~searching-manuals:~$ man challenge
hacker@man~searching-manuals:~$ /challenge/challenge --sjwovo
Initializing...
Correct usage! Your flag: pwn.college{YMT5Wx4bUkI1pFYyzdnDDjbtP-n.QX1EDO0wCN3gjNzEzW}
```

## What I learned
I learnt that we can use `/` to search inside the manual and use `?` to search backwards.
