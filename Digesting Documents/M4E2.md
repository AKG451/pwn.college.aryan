# Challenge Name
Digesting Documents: Learning complex usage

## My solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{U_eGHgi5juUj7yQaCgxCDV_Xr-A.QX1ITO0wCN3gjNzEzW}`

In this challenge we once again had the same command i.e `/challenge/challenge` but we had to run it with `--printfile` and this argument required another argument. The argument that we pass to `--printfile` is basically the file who's content we wanna read out in the terminal.
To solve this challenge i first tried to figure out which file has the flag:
```bash
hacker@man~learning-complex-usage:~$ find
.
./.config
./.bash_history
./a
./not-the-flag
```
After knowing the files present i tried to `cat` just in case i may get the flag just as it is but unfortunately it didn't work out.
```bash
hacker@man~learning-complex-usage:~$ cat ./not-the-flag
cat: ./not-the-flag: Permission denied
```
Since the previous shortcut I was trying didn't work I went with the conventional method and got the flag:
```bash
hacker@man~learning-complex-usage:~$ /challenge/challenge --printfile not-the-flag
Correct argument! Here is the not-the-flag file:
pwn.college{U_eGHgi5juUj7yQaCgxCDV_Xr-A.QX1ITO0wCN3gjNzEzW}
```

## What I learned
I learnt that every documentation has a apropriate way in which we should run it or else it won't run properly.
