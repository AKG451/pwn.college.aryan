Hello Hackers: Intro to arguments

## My solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{0svpX2zj0pi47C4pWzSLkgRGxCZ.QX4YjM1wCN3gjNzEzW}`

I got to know about command and argument. We were told to use command "hello" and argument "hackers" that's what i did and got the flag.

```bash
hacker@hello~intro-to-arguments:~$ hello hackers
Success! Here is your flag:
pwn.college{0svpX2zj0pi47C4pWzSLkgRGxCZ.QX4YjM1wCN3gjNzEzW}
```

## What I learned
Command: Basically it is what we wanna do for echo is a command or mv is also a command.
Argument: This is basically where the change or how the change would occur that is how the command would occur.
