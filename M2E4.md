# Challenge Name
Pondering Paths: Position Elsewhere

## My solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{wSFsvxBt0k-dBswdjj3Hfree7Fy.QX3QTN0wCN3gjNzEzW}`

I first ran "/challenge/run" so that i can know in which directory i have to run the command. After i got to know which directory i have to run it in i changed directory using cd command and after entering that directory i ran the final command i.e "/challenge/run" which gave me the reward flag
```bash
hacker@paths~position-elsewhere:~$ /challenge/run
Incorrect...
You are not currently in the /usr/include directory.
Please use the `cd` utility to change directory appropriately.
hacker@paths~position-elsewhere:~$ cd /usr/include
hacker@paths~position-elsewhere:/usr/include$ /challenge/run
Correct!!!
/challenge/run is an absolute path, invoked from the right directory!
Here is your flag:
pwn.college{wSFsvxBt0k-dBswdjj3Hfree7Fy.QX3QTN0wCN3gjNzEzW}
```

## What I learned
I learnt about the "cd" command and how to use it
