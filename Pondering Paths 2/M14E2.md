# Challenge Name
Setting Paths

## My solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{89eplnLqm-tUzRVTPNV68lEPJ36.QX1cjM1wCN3gjNzEzW}`

Since the command was in `/challenge/more_commands/` I just set my path to it and ran the `/challenge/run` command. This gave me the flag.
```bash
hacker@path~setting-path:~$ PATH=/challenge/more_commands/
hacker@path~setting-path:~$ /challenge/run
Invoking 'win'....
Congratulations! You properly set the flag and 'win' has launched!
