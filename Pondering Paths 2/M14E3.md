# Challenge Name
Finding Commands

## My solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{8KeYbL1a2PQKrmwCKltFW8aIuUa.01NzEzNxwCN3gjNzEzW}`

I used the which command to find the path of win command since the flag was inthe same path I just cat it to get the flag
```bash
hacker@path~finding-commands:~$ which win
/challenge/paths/32675/win
hacker@path~finding-commands:~$ cat /challenge/paths/32675/flag
pwn.college{8KeYbL1a2PQKrmwCKltFW8aIuUa.01NzEzNxwCN3gjNzEzW}
```
