# Challenge Name
The path variable

## My solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{830o2TbFzF3wMhfjKcUpckeuR_v.QX2cDM1wCN3gjNzEzW}`

I set the current path to nothing this will disallow it to access the rm command. To do this I used the `PATH=""` command
```bash
hacker@path~the-path-variable:~$ PATH=""
hacker@path~the-path-variable:~$ /challenge/run
Trying to remove /flag...
/challenge/run: line 4: rm: No such file or directory
The flag is still there! I might as well give it to you!
pwn.college{830o2TbFzF3wMhfjKcUpckeuR_v.QX2cDM1wCN3gjNzEzW}
```

## What I learned
