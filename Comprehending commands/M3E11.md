# Challenge Name
Comprehending commands: hidden files

## My solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{0YupSODxQk5oMOyp10ermZDB4hq.QXwUDO0wCN3gjNzEzW}`

In this problem we had to -a to find hidden files and retrieve flag from there because ls doesn't list all the files by default. Linux has a convention where files that start with a . don't show up by default in ls.
```bash
hacker@commands~hidden-files:~$ ls -a /
.flag-248282221314573
hacker@commands~hidden-files:~$ cat /.flag-248282221314573
pwn.college{0YupSODxQk5oMOyp10ermZDB4hq.QXwUDO0wCN3gjNzEzW}
```

## What I learned
