# Challenge Name
Comprehending commands: catting absolute paths

## My solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{4OMa8Pi2MS4dvPtKeohr-I5TzrL.QXwITO0wCN3gjNzEzW}`

In this problem we had "flag" file in the /lib/emacs/flag directory and we had to concatenate it to read it's content and get the flag
```bash
You cannot use the 'cd' command in this level, and must retrieve the flag by 
absolute path. Plus, I hid the flag in a different directory! You can find it 
in the file /lib/emacs/flag. Go cat it out **without** cding into that 
directory!
hacker@commands~more-catting-practice:~$ cat /lib/emacs/flag
pwn.college{4OMa8Pi2MS4dvPtKeohr-I5TzrL.QXwITO0wCN3gjNzEzW}
```

## What I learned
cat command and how to use it for absolute paths
