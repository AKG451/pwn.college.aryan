# Challenge Name
Comprehending commands: making directories

## My solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{0mGoDq9W-IYu52DK1xisYRM8gDt.QXxMDO0wCN3gjNzEzW}`

In this problem we had to make a new directory using mkdir command and create a new file in it called college to get the flag.
```bash
hacker@commands~making-directories:~$ mkdir /tmp/pwn
hacker@commands~making-directories:~$ cd /tmp/pwn
hacker@commands~making-directories:/tmp/pwn$ touch college
hacker@commands~making-directories:/tmp/pwn$ /challenge/run
Success! Here is your flag:
pwn.college{0mGoDq9W-IYu52DK1xisYRM8gDt.QXxMDO0wCN3gjNzEzW}
```
