# Challenge Name
Comprehending commands: cat

## My solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{Abxs8om1po2MvngLQikpDEgovmm.QXxcTN0wCN3gjNzEzW}`

In this problem we had "flag" file in the home directory and we just had to concatenate it to read it's content and get the flag
```bash
hacker@commands~cat-not-the-pet-but-the-command:~$ cat flag
pwn.college{Abxs8om1po2MvngLQikpDEgovmm.QXxcTN0wCN3gjNzEzW}
```

## What I learned
cat command and how to use it
