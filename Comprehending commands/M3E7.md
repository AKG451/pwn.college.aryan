# Challenge Name
Comprehending commands: listing files

## My solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{401tU_Xe7Pmkcaos0Brq52KuaaZ.QX4IDO0wCN3gjNzEzW}`

In this problem we had to list all files in the directory since they had renamed the run file to something else. After finding the renamed file we just had to run it to get the flag.
```bash
hacker@commands~listing-files:~$ ls /challenge
27604-renamed-run-14059  DESCRIPTION.md
hacker@commands~listing-files:~$ /challenge/27604-renamed-run-14059
Yahaha, you found me! Here is your flag:
pwn.college{401tU_Xe7Pmkcaos0Brq52KuaaZ.QX4IDO0wCN3gjNzEzW}
```
