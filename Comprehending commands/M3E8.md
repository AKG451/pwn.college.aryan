# Challenge Name
Comprehending commands: touching files

## My solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{401tU_Xe7Pmkcaos0Brq52KuaaZ.QX4IDO0wCN3gjNzEzW}`

In this problem we had to create two files using the touch command and then run the /challenge/run to get the flag.
```bash
hacker@commands~touching-files:~$ touch /tmp/pwn /tmp/college
hacker@commands~touching-files:~$ /challenge/run
Success! Here is your flag:
pwn.college{AftXxsVXnCkrqKS4ZtKHiHx9-NU.QXwMDO0wCN3gjNzEzW}
```
