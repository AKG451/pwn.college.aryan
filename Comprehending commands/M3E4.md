# Challenge Name
Comprehending commands: grepping for a needle in a haystack

## My solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{QrDUJ3k8Zx7TfuHdFQG7fH0LjnZ.QX3EDO0wCN3gjNzEzW}`

In this problem the flag was in a file containing thousands of lines of codes hence catting it would've been stupid hence grep command comes into picture. This command can search for a specific kind of text in the whole files. Since every flag starts from "pwn.college" I did "grep pwn.college" in the neccesary directory to get the flag.
```bash
hacker@commands~grepping-for-a-needle-in-a-haystack:~$ grep pwn.college /challenge/data.txt
pwn.college{QrDUJ3k8Zx7TfuHdFQG7fH0LjnZ.QX3EDO0wCN3gjNzEzW}
```
