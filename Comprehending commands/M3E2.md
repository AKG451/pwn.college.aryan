# Challenge Name
Comprehending commands: catting absolute paths

## My solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{QmSgPduBHqojNR1x-LggNQnAet6.QX5ETO0wCN3gjNzEzW}`

In this problem we had "flag" file in the /flag directory and we had to concatenate it to read it's content and get the flag
```bash
hacker@commands~catting-absolute-paths:~$ cat /flag
pwn.college{QmSgPduBHqojNR1x-LggNQnAet6.QX5ETO0wCN3gjNzEzW}
```

## What I learned
cat command and how to use it for absolute paths
