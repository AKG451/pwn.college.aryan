# Challenge Name
Comprehending commands: comparing files

## My solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{8TWC--2kgnLtc5gJ_jbHyXCgt9K.01MwMDOxwCN3gjNzEzW}`

In this problem the two files contained hundreds of fake flags but the real.txt had one extra i.e real flag and our objective was to use the diff command to find the different real flag. Hence I executed the command and got the flag.
```bash
hacker@commands~comparing-files:~$ diff /challenge/decoys_only.txt /challenge/decoys_and_real.txt
1a2
> pwn.college{8TWC--2kgnLtc5gJ_jbHyXCgt9K.01MwMDOxwCN3gjNzEzW}
```
