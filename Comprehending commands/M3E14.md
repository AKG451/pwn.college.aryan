# Challenge Name
Comprehending commands: finding files

## My solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{kjtN8AnYMojaAQp6Jg2p1flxBza.QXyMDO0wCN3gjNzEzW}`

I took ai help to find the command for finding flag only in user accesible directories and hence i found 3 paths. I decided to check the third path first and lcukily it had the correct flag which i got using concatenation.
```bash
hacker@commands~finding-files:~$ find /home /opt /var /usr -name flag 2>/dev/null
/opt/pwndbg/.venv/lib/python3.8/site-packages/pwnlib/flag
/usr/local/lib/python3.8/dist-packages/pwnlib/flag
/usr/share/locale/son/flag
hacker@commands~finding-files:~$ cat /usr/share/locale/son/flag
pwn.college{kjtN8AnYMojaAQp6Jg2p1flxBza.QXyMDO0wCN3gjNzEzW}
```

## What I learned
I learnt how to use find command and effectively use it.
