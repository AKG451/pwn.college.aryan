# Challenge Name
Pondering Paths: Position yet elsewhere

## My solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{wY-7v8lkDeApLNZQglCKEE2LP6Z.QX4QTN0wCN3gjNzEzW}`

I first ran "/challenge/run" so that i can know in which directory i have to run the command. After i got to know which directory i have to run it in i changed directory using cd command and after entering that directory i ran the final command i.e "/challenge/run" which gave me the reward flag
```bash
hacker@paths~position-yet-elsewhere:~$ /challenge/run
Incorrect...
You are not currently in the /var directory.
Please use the `cd` utility to change directory appropriately.
hacker@paths~position-yet-elsewhere:~$ cd /var
hacker@paths~position-yet-elsewhere:/var$ /challenge/run
Correct!!!
/challenge/run is an absolute path, invoked from the right directory!
Here is your flag:
pwn.college{wY-7v8lkDeApLNZQglCKEE2LP6Z.QX4QTN0wCN3gjNzEzW}
```
