# Challenge Name
Perceiving Permissions:

## My solve
**Flag:** ``

I tried solving this question wrong multiple times. After trying to solve it for around half hour I finally decided to get some help using Gemini AI. Gemini AI gave me a better way to handle this question and then used the method to finally get the answer. I have attached the method that I learnt from it.

r-x	          5

You've solved all 8 rounds! I have changed the ownership
of the /flag file so that you can 'chmod' it. You won't be able to read
it until you make it readable with chmod!

Current permissions of "/flag": ---------
- the user doesn't have read permissions
- the user doesn't have write permissions
- the user doesn't have execute permissions
- the group doesn't have read permissions
- the group doesn't have write permissions
- the group doesn't have execute permissions
- the world doesn't have read permissions
- the world doesn't have write permissions
- the world doesn't have execute permissions
