# Challenge Name
Perceiving Permissions: Executable Files

## My solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{QTy8MONmRyaoyl-YrGopuvt4qVd.QXyEjN0wCN3gjNzEzW}`

This is the standard command to make a file executable the reason I already know about this is citadel ctf in which I had to use this command.
```bash
hacker@permissions~executable-files:~$ chmod +x /challenge/run
hacker@permissions~executable-files:~$ /challenge/run
Successful execution! Here is your flag:
pwn.college{QTy8MONmRyaoyl-YrGopuvt4qVd.QXyEjN0wCN3gjNzEzW}
```
