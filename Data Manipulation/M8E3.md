# Challenge Name
Data Manipulation: Deleting newlines

## My solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{MVzZTuKcoV8e-XLqbcoeoezmkq8.0VNxEzNxwCN3gjNzEzW}`

This exercise was similar to the last one but instead of the text to delete we had to `\n` inside `''`.
```bash
hacker@data~deleting-newlines:~$ /challenge/run | tr -d '\n'
Your line-split flag: pwn.college{MVzZTuKcoV8e-XLqbcoeoezmkq8.0VNxEzNxwCN3gjNzEzW}
```

## References
