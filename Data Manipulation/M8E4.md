# Challenge Name
Data Manipulation: Extracting the first lines with head

## My solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{wcMdw65fDkRjH28NZedMAVuNNUq.0lNxEzNxwCN3gjNzEzW}`

This exercise combined the usage of a triple pipe along with the use of `head -n 7` to get the first 7 lines of the `/challenge/pwn` file and then I used another pipe to redirect it to `/challenge/college`.
```bash
hacker@data~extracting-the-first-lines-with-head:~$ /challenge/pwn | head -n 7 | /challenge/college
Congratulations, you piped the right codes!
pwn.college{wcMdw65fDkRjH28NZedMAVuNNUq.0lNxEzNxwCN3gjNzEzW}
```

## What I learned
I learnt how to use the `head` command to read the first few lines of a file/program.
