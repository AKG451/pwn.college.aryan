# Challenge Name
Data Manipulation: Extracting specific sections

## My solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{MuN3HrhOSMZkVTdcB7aEu9YIVjn.01NxEzNxwCN3gjNzEzW}`

I at first didn't knew which all columns to select so i left the argument for `-f` empty thinking that it will automatically consider all columns but i was wrong and hence encountered the below error.
```bash
hacker@data~extracting-specific-sections-of-text:~$ /challenge/run | cut -d " " -f | tr -d '\n'
cut: option requires an argument -- 'f'
Try 'cut --help' for more information.
/challenge/run: line 4: echo: write error: Broken pipe
...`(more things were ahead but i can't paste it all or else it will become unnecessarily long)`
```
After this i decided to take the help of gemini and asked it how to figure out which column should i target. Gemini suggested to run the `/challenge/run` file itself so as to get an idea about in which column all the flag elements are.
```bash
hacker@data~extracting-specific-sections-of-text:~$ /challenge/run
3875 p
223 w
25324 n
30503 .
13834 c
26733 o
28400 l
...`(more things were ahead but i can't paste it all or else it will become unnecessarily long)`
```
I could've used the `head` command also for looking for which column contains flag elements but unfortunately i forgot that while doing this exercise.
I then finally ran the correct command with argument `2` for `-f` and finally got the flag.
```bash
hacker@data~extracting-specific-sections-of-text:~$ /challenge/run | cut -d " " -f 2 | tr -d '\n'
pwn.college{MuN3HrhOSMZkVTdcB7aEu9YIVjn.01NxEzNxwCN3gjNzEzW}
```

## What I learned
I learnt how to delete specific sections and also how to extract them.
