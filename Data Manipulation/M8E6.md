# Challenge Name
Data Manipulation: Sorting data

## My solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{oD9iyT2eysQt6NF_dlw6JEheidi.0FM0MDOxwCN3gjNzEzW}`

In this question i ran `sort` for `/challenge/flag.txt` this prints all the content(flags in this case) of the file "flag.txt" in alphabetical order and in the question it was told that the lasr one is the correct one.
```bash
hacker@data~sorting-data:~$ sort /challenge/flags.txt
what followed next were hundreds of flags out of which the last one was the real one.
```

## What I learned
I learnt how to sort any file content alphabetically.
