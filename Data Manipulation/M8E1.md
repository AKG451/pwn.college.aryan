# Challenge Name
Data Manipulation: Translating characters

## My solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{wedpTwcaAESgkhpNJw9u_InRKIB.01MxEzNxwCN3gjNzEzW}`

In this question i didn't knew how to write `'A-Za-z' 'a-zA-Z'` part. I was confused whether to manually type all the uppercase letters and lowercase letters or is there a shortcut. I searched for a shortcut method on gemini ai and hence finally used this syntax.
```bash
hacker@data~translating-characters:~$ /challenge/run | tr 'A-Za-z' 'a-zA-Z'
yOUR CASE-SWAPPED FLAG:
pwn.college{wedpTwcaAESgkhpNJw9u_InRKIB.01MxEzNxwCN3gjNzEzW}
```

## What I learned
I learnt how to change texts in an file/command and also i learnt how to reverse the casing of alphabets i.e `A to a` and vice-versa.
