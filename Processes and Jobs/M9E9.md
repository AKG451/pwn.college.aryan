# Challenge Name
Backgrounding Processes

## My solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{E4DIAYfkZ8GaRrmyFo0GtBHEL6X.QX5QDO0wCN3gjNzEzW}`

I followed the basic syntax that is i appended `/challenge/run` with an & to get it running in the background without appending it.
```bash
hacker@processes~starting-backgrounded-processes:~$ /challenge/run &
[1] 161
hacker@processes~starting-backgrounded-processes:~$ 


Yay, you started me in the background! Because of that, this text will probably 
overlap weirdly with the shell prompt, but you're used to that by now...

Anyways! Here is your flag!
pwn.college{E4DIAYfkZ8GaRrmyFo0GtBHEL6X.QX5QDO0wCN3gjNzEzW}
```
