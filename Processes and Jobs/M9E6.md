# Challenge Name
Processes and Jobs: Resuming processes 

## My solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{khHxZr1iIS7JDpSlFQVWWkOCbph.QX2QDO0wCN3gjNzEzW}`

This was quite straightforward I had to run the `/challenge/run` command and after that I simply had to suspend it using `ctrl+z` after which I used the `fg` command to resume the process to get the flag.
```bash
hacker@processes~resuming-processes:~$ /challenge/run
Let's practice resuming processes! Suspend me with Ctrl-Z, then resume me with 
the 'fg' command! Or just press Enter to quit me!
^Z
[1]+  Stopped                 /challenge/run
hacker@processes~resuming-processes:~$ fg
/challenge/run
I'm back! Here's your flag:
pwn.college{khHxZr1iIS7JDpSlFQVWWkOCbph.QX2QDO0wCN3gjNzEzW}
Don't forget to press Enter to quit me!

Goodbye!
```
