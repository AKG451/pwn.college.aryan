# Challenge Name
Processes and Jobs: Suspending processes 

## My solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{86p3nJ1mUok1M7Qhtd6AQ9XWbQy.QX1QDO0wCN3gjNzEzW}`

I ran the `/challenge/run` command and then did ctrl+z and after that i can run `/challenge/run` to get the flag.
```bash
hacker@processes~suspending-processes:~$ /challenge/run
I'll only give you the flag if there's already another copy of me running in 
this terminal... Let's check!

UID          PID    PPID  C STIME TTY          TIME CMD
root         162     129  0 04:28 pts/0    00:00:00 bash /challenge/
root         164     162  0 04:28 pts/0    00:00:00 ps -f

I don't see a second me!

To pass this level, you need to suspend me and launch me again! You can 
background me with Ctrl-Z or, if you're not ready to do that for whatever 
reason, just hit Enter and I'll exit!

Yay, I found another version of me! Here is the flag:
