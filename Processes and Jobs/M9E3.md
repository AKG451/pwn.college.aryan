# Challenge Name
Processes and Jobs: Interupting processes 

## My solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{EjjPK70ekiLxZGFgwzO6xC_oP_-.QXzQDO0wCN3gjNzEzW}`

When trying to run `/challenge/run` for the first time we don't get the flag since there is a proccess that is clogging up the terminal to exit from such proccess we just have to use `CTRL+C` on the keyboard.
```bash
hacker@processes~interrupting-processes:~$ /challenge/run
I could give you the flag... but I won't, until this process exits. Remember, 
you can force me to exit with Ctrl-C. Try it now!
^C
Good job! You have used Ctrl-C to interrupt this process! Here is your flag:
pwn.college{EjjPK70ekiLxZGFgwzO6xC_oP_-.QXzQDO0wCN3gjNzEzW}
```

## What I learned
