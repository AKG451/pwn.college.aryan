Chaining Commands: Building on success

## My solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{QKD-YCn8It70ZG2JdD08XQpAzsF.0lM0MDOxwCN3gjNzEzW}`

This is a already known command i.e `&&` I have used it multiple times in my writeups too.
```bash
hacker@chaining~building-on-success:~$ /challenge/first-success && /challenge/second
