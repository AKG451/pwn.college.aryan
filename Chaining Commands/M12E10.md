# Challenge Name
Scripting with default cases

## My solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{s2sX3bLiOH3E_2TKMUB7z9Me-Nf.01NzMDOxwCN3gjNzEzW}`

This question was similar to the last question just I had to add a else statement also. All the other steps are same.
```bash
hacker@chaining~scripting-with-default-cases:~$ echo 'if [ "$1" == "pwn" ]; then echo "college"; else echo "nope"; fi' > /home/hacker/solve.sh
hacker@chaining~scripting-with-default-cases:~$ chmod +x /home/hacker/solve.sh
hacker@chaining~scripting-with-default-cases:~$ /challenge/run
Correct! Your script properly handles the if/else conditions.
Here's your flag:
pwn.college{s2sX3bLiOH3E_2TKMUB7z9Me-Nf.01NzMDOxwCN3gjNzEzW}
```
