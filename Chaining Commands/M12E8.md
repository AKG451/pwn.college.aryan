Scripting with arguments

## My solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{8Q65Yj7R27JPbL9FA70QyB9Wd3e.0VNzMDOxwCN3gjNzEzW}`

For this question I searched on Gemini AI for how to accept arguments in a script. After learning that I finally got into solving the question. I first wrote the shebang line. Then I made it so that it can accept arguments. Final after making it executable I ran the final command to get the flag.
```bash
hacker@chaining~scripting-with-arguments:~$ echo '#!/bin/bash' > /home/hacker/solve.sh
hacker@chaining~scripting-with-arguments:~$ echo 'echo "$2" "$1"' >> /home/hacker/solve.sh
hacker@chaining~scripting-with-arguments:~$ chmod +x /home/hacker/solve.sh
hacker@chaining~scripting-with-arguments:~$ /challenge/run
Correct! Your script properly reversed the arguments.
Here's your flag:
pwn.college{8Q65Yj7R27JPbL9FA70QyB9Wd3e.0VNzMDOxwCN3gjNzEzW}
```
