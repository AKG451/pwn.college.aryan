# Challenge Name
Executable shell script

## My solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{8LyDxRW84DER1gmzXwtWMDKL75Q.QX0cjM1wCN3gjNzEzW}`

I first made a cscript named sol.sh and then made it executable using the chmod command just like what we previously have learnt after all this I finally run the script without bash and get the flag.
```bash
hacker@chaining~executable-shell-scripts:~$ echo /challenge/solve > sol.sh
hacker@chaining~executable-shell-scripts:~$ chmod +x sol.sh
hacker@chaining~executable-shell-scripts:~$ ./sol.sh
Congratulations on your shell script execution! Your flag:
pwn.college{8LyDxRW84DER1gmzXwtWMDKL75Q.QX0cjM1wCN3gjNzEzW}
```
