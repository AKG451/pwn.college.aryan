# Challenge Name
Chaining commands: Chaining with semicolons

## My solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{IBrajbgiclChEOxTIe4XaCwe0PV.QX1UDO0wCN3gjNzEzW}`

Another simple challenge I just had to put a semi-colon between `/challenge/pwn` and `/challenge/college`.
```bash
hacker@chaining~chaining-with-semicolons:~$ /challenge/pwn;/challenge/college
Yes! You chained /challenge/pwn and /challenge/college! Here is your flag:
pwn.college{IBrajbgiclChEOxTIe4XaCwe0PV.QX1UDO0wCN3gjNzEzW}
```

## What I learned
I learnt how to execute one command after another in a single line using a semicolon.
