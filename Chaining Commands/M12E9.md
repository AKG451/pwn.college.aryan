# Challenge Name
Scripting with conditionals

## My solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{kzTpcGvWfZYnfl9CGENMA-oojat.0lNzMDOxwCN3gjNzEzW}`

I decided to write everything in a single line but we can also use nano command to edit. Infact we can edit the solve.sh script even in vscode. I didn't use those since I have used them only once for setting up my bash.rc file for ros2 humble package. Basically what this command I wrote does is that it checks if the argument is pwn, if it is pwn then it will simply echo "college". I then made the script file as a executable using chmod command. Finally I ran the challenge/run command to get the flag.
```bash
hacker@chaining~scripting-with-conditionals:~$ echo 'if [ "$1" == "pwn" ]; then echo "college"; fi' > /home/hacker/solve.sh
hacker@chaining~scripting-with-conditionals:~$ chmod +x /home/hacker/solve.sh
hacker@chaining~scripting-with-conditionals:~$ /challenge/run
Correct! Your script properly handles all the conditions.
Here's your flag:
pwn.college{kzTpcGvWfZYnfl9CGENMA-oojat.0lNzMDOxwCN3gjNzEzW}
```
