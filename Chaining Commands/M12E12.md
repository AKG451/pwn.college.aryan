# Challenge Name
Reading Shell scripts

## My solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{cYGIW090dmXl1oRgvF-DvQlDf4o.0lMwgDOxwCN3gjNzEzW}`

I first read the run command and got to know that it wants a `hack the PLANET` argument so that's what I did. I ran the run command and then entered the required argument to get the flag.
```bash
hacker@chaining~reading-shell-scripts:~$ cat /challenge/run
#!/opt/pwn.college/bash

read GUESS
if [ "$GUESS" == "hack the PLANET" ]
then
        echo "CORRECT! Your flag:"
        cat /flag
else
        echo "Read the /challenge/run file to figure out the correct password!"
fi
hacker@chaining~reading-shell-scripts:~$ /challenge/run
hack the PLANET
CORRECT! Your flag:
pwn.college{cYGIW090dmXl1oRgvF-DvQlDf4o.0lMwgDOxwCN3gjNzEzW}
```
