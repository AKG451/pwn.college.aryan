# Challenge Name
Scripting with multiple conditions

## My solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{0rmDc8LnzlTdOPsP1YBfEt5xUQq.0FOzMDOxwCN3gjNzEzW}`

This question was also similar to the last one but this time I used elif statements to fulfil the conditions given int the question
```bash
hacker@chaining~scripting-with-multiple-conditions:~$ echo 'if [ "$1" == "hack" ]; then echo "the planet"; elif [ "$1" == "pwn" ]; then echo "college"; elif [ "$1" == "learn" ]; then echo "linux"; else echo "unknown"; fi' > /home/hacker/solve.sh
hacker@chaining~scripting-with-multiple-conditions:~$ chmod +x /home/hacker/solve.sh
hacker@chaining~scripting-with-multiple-conditions:~$ /challenge/run
Correct! Your script properly handles all the conditions with elif.
Here's your flag:
pwn.college{0rmDc8LnzlTdOPsP1YBfEt5xUQq.0FOzMDOxwCN3gjNzEzW}
```
