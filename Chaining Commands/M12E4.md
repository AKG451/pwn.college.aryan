# Challenge Name
Chaining commands: Chaining your first shell script

## My solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{cUMm-5_GPS_ygo9NwRllX9LwNjd.QXxcDO0wCN3gjNzEzW}`

I first added `/challenge/pwn` to x.sh and then `/challenge/college` to x.sh after which I finally ran the script to get my flag
```bash
hacker@chaining~your-first-shell-script:~$ echo /challenge/pwn > x.sh
hacker@chaining~your-first-shell-script:~$ echo /challenge/college >> x.sh
hacker@chaining~your-first-shell-script:~$ bash x.sh
Great job, you've written your first shell script! Here is the flag:
pwn.college{cUMm-5_GPS_ygo9NwRllX9LwNjd.QXxcDO0wCN3gjNzEzW}
```
