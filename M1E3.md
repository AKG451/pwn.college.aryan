# Challenge Name
Hello Hackers: Commands History

## My solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{M36yH0G6zbP1EJsOYUuIiHmXPcU.0lNzEzNxwCN3gjNzEzW}`

We had to click the ^(up) button on our keyboard to check all the previous command we have run doing so gave me the flag for this exercise. 
```bash
hacker@hello~command-history:~$ the flag is pwn.college{M36yH0G6zbP1EJsOYUuIiHmXPcU.0lNzEzNxwCN3gjNzEzW}
```

## What I learned
I learnt that we can visit and look back all the commands we have run so far in the terminal

## References 
None
