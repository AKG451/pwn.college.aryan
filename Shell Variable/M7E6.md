# Challenge Name
Shell Variables : Storing command output

## My solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{gCQokxEqRi9MQsMg9YRslRn9uG7.QX1cDN1wCN3gjNzEzW}`

In this exercise I first saved the `/challenge/run` command into the variable name `PWN` after that I just read it using the `echo` command to get the flag.
```bash
hacker@variables~storing-command-output:~$ PWN=$(/challenge/run)
Congratulations! You have read the flag into the PWN variable. Now print it out 
and submit it!
hacker@variables~storing-command-output:~$ echo "$PWN"
pwn.college{gCQokxEqRi9MQsMg9YRslRn9uG7.QX1cDN1wCN3gjNzEzW}
```

## What I learned
I learnt how to store commands in a variable and how to read that variable.
