# Challenge Name
Shell Variables : Setting variables

## My solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{4Ff1fhMVgwHWboTOMdeQkdxz8-T.QX5UTN0wCN3gjNzEzW}`

This one was also very straightforward and i just had to assign `COLLEGE` to the variable
```bash
hacker@variables~setting-variables:~$ PWN=COLLEGE
You've set the PWN variable properly! As promised, here is the flag:
pwn.college{4Ff1fhMVgwHWboTOMdeQkdxz8-T.QX5UTN0wCN3gjNzEzW}
```

## What I learned
