# Challenge Name
Shell Variables : Reading input

## My solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{EtL5YicNeSC2Iq6RoVFghPoq74c.QX4cTN0wCN3gjNzEzW}`

I first asked for input for the PWN variable and after that set the value of PWN variable to `COLLEGE` so as to get the flag.
```bash
hacker@variables~reading-input:~$ read -p "INPUT: " PWN
INPUT: COLLEGE
You've set the PWN variable properly! As promised, here is the flag:
pwn.college{EtL5YicNeSC2Iq6RoVFghPoq74c.QX4cTN0wCN3gjNzEzW}
```
