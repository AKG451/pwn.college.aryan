# Challenge Name
Shell Variables : Multi word variables

## My solve
**Flag:** ``

Similar to the last exercise I assigned a variable a text but this time i had to use a `""` since there were multiple texts.
```bash
hacker@variables~multi-word-variables:~$ PWN="COLLEGE YEAH"
You've set the PWN variable properly! As promised, here is the flag:
pwn.college{odeEjnFnOzZZMvdEKE-ccRCdCGX.QXwYTN0wCN3gjNzEzW}
```

## What I learned
I learnt how to assign values to a variable.
