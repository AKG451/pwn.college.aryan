# Challenge Name
Shell Variables : Printing Exported variables

## My solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{o44wvYbLnXRlRDSDtVMtROabVD7.QX4UTN0wCN3gjNzEzW}`

I just used the env command which printed all the variables stored in the shell and hence i got the flag.
```bash
hacker@variables~exporting-variables:~$ PWN=COLLEGE && COLLEGE=PWN
You've set the PWN variable to the proper value!
You've set the COLLEGE variable to the proper value!
hacker@variables~exporting-variables:~$ export PWN
You've set the PWN variable to the proper value!
You've set the COLLEGE variable to the proper value!
hacker@variables~exporting-variables:~$ sh
sh-5.2$ /challenge/run
CORRECT!
You have exported PWN=COLLEGE and set, but not exported, COLLEGE=PWN. Great 
job! Here is your flag:
pwn.college{IoDr7dKswYFY4nRDmGVviuWW4GM.QXyYTN0wCN3gjNzEzW}
```

## What I learned
