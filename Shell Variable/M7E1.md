# Challenge Name
Shell Variables : Printing variables

## My solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{IVHbHCj2y5KggOioOV5pzzEqg50.QX3UTN0wCN3gjNzEzW}`

This one was straightforward and i just had to echo `FLAG` variable with `$` to get the flag.
```bash
hacker@variables~printing-variables:~$ echo $FLAG
pwn.college{IVHbHCj2y5KggOioOV5pzzEqg50.QX3UTN0wCN3gjNzEzW}
```
