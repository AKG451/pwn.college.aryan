# Challenge Name
Shell Variables : Reading files

## My solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{w3fbON51zb1vkk6Ods428vOHlHw.QXwIDO0wCN3gjNzEzW}`

This was simple I just read variable `PWN` to `/challenge/read_me` and got the flag.
```bash
hacker@variables~reading-files:~$ read PWN < /challenge/read_me 
You've set the PWN variable properly! As promised, here is the flag:
pwn.college{w3fbON51zb1vkk6Ods428vOHlHw.QXwIDO0wCN3gjNzEzW}
```
