# Challenge Name
Pondering Paths: Explicit relative paths

## My solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{wAEUqTmOxgIuF7nuiGf4NkXVKdm.QXwUTN0wCN3gjNzEzW}`

I first ran "/challenge/run" so that i can know in which directory i have to run the command. After i got to know which directory i have to run it in i changed directory using cd command and after entering that directory i ran the final command i.e "./challenge/run" which gave me the reward flag
```bash
hacker@paths~explicit-relative-paths-from-:~$ /challenge/run
Incorrect...
You are not currently in the / directory.
Please use the `cd` utility to change directory appropriately.
hacker@paths~explicit-relative-paths-from-:~$ cd /
hacker@paths~explicit-relative-paths-from-:/$ ./challenge/run
Correct!!!
./challenge/run is a relative path, invoked from the right directory!
Here is your flag:
pwn.college{wAEUqTmOxgIuF7nuiGf4NkXVKdm.QXwUTN0wCN3gjNzEzW}
```

## What I learned
I learnt about explicit relative files i.e how to use "./ and ../"
