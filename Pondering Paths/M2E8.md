# Challenge Name
Pondering Paths: Implicit relative path again

## My solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{IOzmRB3gkTU8BgPMjTD5RPVxx_m.QXxUTN0wCN3gjNzEzW}`

I first ran "cd /challenge" and after coming in the right directory I ran run command but using "./run" because linux doesn't run "run" command as a safety measure
```bash
hacker@paths~implicit-relative-path:~$ cd /challenge
hacker@paths~implicit-relative-path:/challenge$ ./run
Correct!!!
./run is a relative path, invoked from the right directory!
Here is your flag:
pwn.college{IOzmRB3gkTU8BgPMjTD5RPVxx_m.QXxUTN0wCN3gjNzEzW}
```

## What I learned
I learnt about running a file using "./" way
