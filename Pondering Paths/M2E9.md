# Challenge Name
Pondering Paths: Home Sweet Home

## My solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{wxqJj3LIj77Takk_xrMRX8b-_Wm.QXzMDO0wCN3gjNzEzW}`

I first ran "/challenge/run ~a" and after that i got the flag.This was a little confusing program hence some mistakes were made ig
```bash
hacker@paths~home-sweet-home:~$ /challenge/run ~
Writing the file to /home/hacker!
/challenge/run: line 29: /home/hacker: Is a directory
... and reading it back to you:
cat: /home/hacker: Is a directory
hacker@paths~home-sweet-home:~$ cat ~
cat: /home/hacker: Is a directory
hacker@paths~home-sweet-home:~$ cat ~/a
cat: /home/hacker/a: No such file or directory
hacker@paths~home-sweet-home:~$ /challenge/run ~/a
Writing the file to /home/hacker/a!
... and reading it back to you:
pwn.college{wxqJj3LIj77Takk_xrMRX8b-_Wm.QXzMDO0wCN3gjNzEzW}
```

## What I learned
I learnt about home directory and how to switch between different file options
