# Challenge Name
Pondering Paths: Program and absolute paths

## My solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{UgtSRKqRrvoXHbDL-81vyFWlwFW.QX1QTN0wCN3gjNzEzW}`

I just did /challenge/run to access file in run directory by going inside challenge first
```bash
hacker@paths~program-and-absolute-paths:~$ /challenge/run
Correct!!!
/challenge/run is an absolute path! Here is your flag:
pwn.college{UgtSRKqRrvoXHbDL-81vyFWlwFW.QX1QTN0wCN3gjNzEzW}
```
