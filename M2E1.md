# Challenge Name
Pondering Paths: The Root

## My solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{0LtkBIOivgZHhyO7-rypS8YBJCe.QX4cTO0wCN3gjNzEzW}`

Baiscally in this we had to create a root directory named"pwn" which contained the flag to proceed ahead.
```bash
hacker@paths~the-root:~$ /pwn
BOOM!!!
Here is your flag:
pwn.college{0LtkBIOivgZHhyO7-rypS8YBJCe.QX4cTO0wCN3gjNzEzW}
```

## What I learned
I learnt that to declare a root directory we have to declare a absolute path by typing in our terminal "/root_directory_name".
