# Challenge Name
File Globbing: Multiple Globs

## My solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{wHWuYU5GItZTu93rD2fr4b_wRC7.0lM3kjNxwCN3gjNzEzW}`

I first changed my directory to the one which contained all the necessary files after that I ran the command with `*p*` argument this argument basically searches for all files containing p and the command runs those files which finally gives us the requried flag.
```bash
hacker@globbing~multiple-globs:~$ cd /challenge/files
hacker@globbing~multiple-globs:/challenge/files$ /challenge/run *p*
You got it! Here is your flag!
pwn.college{wHWuYU5GItZTu93rD2fr4b_wRC7.0lM3kjNxwCN3gjNzEzW}
```

## What I learned
I learnt how to use the `**` and how to glob multiple files using it.
