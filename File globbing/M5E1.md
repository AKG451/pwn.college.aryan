# Challenge Name
File Globbing: Matching with *

## My solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{EPCXpYfsqwDBU17gdiZwmCkeaFE.QXxIDO0wCN3gjNzEzW}`

First I ran `cd c*e` because the word limit for the argument was 4 only but it didn't since i forgot to put `/` in front of `c*e`. Hence I retired and got the flag.I used Gemini AI in this task to learn about `*` more and also how to change directories using `*`.
```bash
hacker@globbing~matching-with-:~$ cd c*e
bash: cd: c*e: No such file or directory

hacker@globbing~matching-with-:~$ cd /c*e
hacker@globbing~matching-with-:/challenge$ ./run
You ran me with the working directory of /challenge! Here is your flag:
pwn.college{EPCXpYfsqwDBU17gdiZwmCkeaFE.QXxIDO0wCN3gjNzEzW}
```

## What I learned
I learnt how to use the `*` and how to change directories using it.
