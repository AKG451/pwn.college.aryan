# Challenge Name
File Globbing: Mixing Globs

## My solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{8HYifgu477dBQFKBZyp_aNCqorT.QX1IDO0wCN3gjNzEzW}`

I first changed the directory and tried to find the common elements between education,challenges and pwn...
I figured out that i will have to somehow search for all files that start with "c" "e" and "p".I first tried to search for all files containg "in" cause that is also common in all files but that didn't work out since we required to use square backet.
```bash
hacker@globbing~mixing-globs:~$ cd /challenges/files
bash: cd: /challenges/files: No such file or directory
hacker@globbing~mixing-globs:~$ cd /challenge/files
hacker@globbing~mixing-globs:/challenge/files$ /challenge/run *in*
Error: you did not use a square bracket glob...
hacker@globbing~mixing-globs:/challenge/files$ /challenge/run [in]
Your expansion did not expand to the requested files (challenging, educational, 
pwning). Instead, it expanded to:
[in]
hacker@globbing~mixing-globs:/challenge/files$ /challenge/run *i*
Error: you did not use a square bracket glob...
```
Now i tried `*[cep]*` but the argument was too long hence i had to take the help of Gemini AI to figure out the error in my thought process and I figured out that we can chop off the initial `*` and the code will work.
After finally running the code I got the flag.
```bash
hacker@globbing~mixing-globs:/challenge/files$ /challenge/run *[cep]*
Error: your argument is too long! It must be 6 characters or less.
hacker@globbing~mixing-globs:/challenge/files$ /challenge/run *[cep]
Your expansion did not expand to the requested files (challenging, educational, 
pwning). Instead, it expanded to:
fantastic incredible nice optimistic
hacker@globbing~mixing-globs:/challenge/files$ /challenge/run [cep]*
You got it! Here is your flag!
pwn.college{8HYifgu477dBQFKBZyp_aNCqorT.QX1IDO0wCN3gjNzEzW}
```

## What I learned
I learnt how to use the various globbing methods together.
