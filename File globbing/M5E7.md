# Challenge Name
File Globbing: Multiple Globs

## My solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{k_Umkf0r2hHX4Mj6_0p5ghGeG4M.QX2IDO0wCN3gjNzEzW}`

I first changed the directory and ran the command for searching all files starting with p,w,n but I put `!` in the start of square brackets which basically filter outs all files starting with p,w,n instead. 
```bash
hacker@globbing~exclusionary-globbing:~$ cd /challenge/files
hacker@globbing~exclusionary-globbing:/challenge/files$ /challenge/run [!pwn]*
You got it! Here is your flag!
pwn.college{k_Umkf0r2hHX4Mj6_0p5ghGeG4M.QX2IDO0wCN3gjNzEzW}
```

## What I learned
I learnt how to use `! and ^` command for filtering out files.
