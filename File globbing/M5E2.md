# Challenge Name
File Globbing: Matching with ?

## My solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{oHUNjWau-tIUj-gqXgRh8bHYMet.QXyIDO0wCN3gjNzEzW}`

This one was easier since I had already read about `*`. In this i just ran the `cd` command along with `/challenge` by just replacing c and l for `?`. After that i ran the `./run` command to get the final flag.
```bash
hacker@globbing~matching-with-:~$ cd /?ha??enge
hacker@globbing~matching-with-:/challenge$ ./run
You ran me with the working directory of /challenge! Here is your flag:
pwn.college{oHUNjWau-tIUj-gqXgRh8bHYMet.QXyIDO0wCN3gjNzEzW}
```

## What I learned
I learnt how to use the `?` and how to change directories using it.
