# Challenge Name
File Globbing: Matching with []

## My solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{cfZup8hxi0Fxh5HggjSymVjm2LO.QX0IDO0wCN3gjNzEzW}`

This one was straight forward we just had to run `/challenge/run` command for `file_[bash]` by specifying `/challenge/files` as the path where the files were stored.
```bash
hacker@globbing~matching-paths-with-:~$ /challenge/run /challenge/files/file_[bash]
You got it! Here is your flag!
pwn.college{cfZup8hxi0Fxh5HggjSymVjm2LO.QX0IDO0wCN3gjNzEzW}
```

## What I learned
I learnt how to use the `[]` and how to match file paths using it.
