# Challenge Name
File Globbing: Matching with []

## My solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{oHUNjWau-tIUj-gqXgRh8bHYMet.QXyIDO0wCN3gjNzEzW}`

First i changed the directory as said and after that I ran the final command with `[bash]` because that's the aprropriate way to match files "files_b,a,s,h".
```bash
hacker@globbing~matching-with-:~$ cd /challenge/files
hacker@globbing~matching-with-:/challenge/files$ /challenge/run file_[bash]
You got it! Here is your flag!
pwn.college{8Na_sCznCsF77CgV6RA7BtBH6qD.QXzIDO0wCN3gjNzEzW}
```

## What I learned
I learnt how to use the `[]` and how to match files using it.
