# Challenge Name
Terminal Multiplexing: Detaching and Attaching

## My solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{w_iZZ3GPvlu2q96S4JI1jROH3x-.0lN4IDOxwCN3gjNzEzW}`

I first executed the screen command and then dettached from it using ctrl+a and then pressing d. I ran /challenge/run next after which I reattached to get the flag.
```bash
hacker@terminal-multiplexing~detaching-and-attaching:~$ echo Yes! Flag is: pwn.college{w_iZZ3GPvlu2q96S4JI1jROH3x-.0lN4IDOxwCN3gjNzEzW}
```
