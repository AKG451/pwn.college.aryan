# Challenge Name
Terminal Multiplexing: Finding Sessions

## My solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{snrU_VJbQ50Tj38ED1x4HcqS9ux.01N4IDOxwCN3gjNzEzW}`

I did `screen -ls to know which all screens were running I decided to first reattach to the 2nd one and luckily that contained the right flag
```bash
hacker@terminal-multiplexing~finding-sessions:~$  echo 'Congratulations! You found the right session!'
Congratulations! You found the right session!
hacker@terminal-multiplexing~finding-sessions:~$  echo pwn.college{snrU_VJbQ50Tj38ED1x4HcqS9ux.01N4IDOxwCN3gjNzEzW}
pwn.college{snrU_VJbQ50Tj38ED1x4HcqS9ux.01N4IDOxwCN3gjNzEzW}
```

## What I learned
How to check all the screens running in the background
