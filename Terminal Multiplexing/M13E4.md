# Challenge Name
Terminal Multiplexing: Switching windows

## My solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{sPszZtouSWRB8lgAZNXFj-2WRUY.0FO4IDOxwCN3gjNzEzW}`

I simply did screen -r which attached me to window 1 after which I had to do `ctrl+A 0` to get to window 0 and get the flag there
```bash
I don't have anything to paste here since the challenge involved only screen -r and ctrl+a 0 commands
```

## What I learned
How to switch between windows

## References
