# Challenge Name
Detaching and attaching with temux

## My solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{8UTdHt-M-kXV6h_rygXCZYpzR_V.0VO4IDOxwCN3gjNzEzW}`

THis was same as the screen command but instead of ctrl A I had to use ctrl B. Firstly we had to start tmux from `tmux` command after which i had to detach from it using ctrlb and followed by d. After detaching we had to run `/challenge/run` and finally reattach with tmux a to get the flag.

```bash
hacker@terminal-multiplexing~detaching-and-attaching-tmux:~$  echo Congratulations, here is your flag: pwn.college{8UTdHt-M-kXV6h_rygXCZYpzR_V.0VO4IDOxwCN3gjNzEzW}
