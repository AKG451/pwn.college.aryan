# Challenge Name
Practicing Piping: Redirecting more output

## My solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{Es4TX-T4oRsj5WwY-anDA5GvEoL.QX1YTN0wCN3gjNzEzW}`

I used the basic syntax taught in the pwn.college documentation and replace hi with /challenge/run and asdf with myflag to get the flag.
```bash
hacker@piping~redirecting-more-output:~$ /challenge/run > myflag
[INFO] WELCOME! This challenge makes the following asks of you:

[HYPE] ONWARDS TO GREATNESS!

[INFO] This challenge will perform a bunch of checks.
[INFO] If you pass these checks, you will receive the /flag file.

[PASS] The file at the other end of my stdout looks okay!
[PASS] Success! You have satisfied all execution requirements.
hacker@piping~redirecting-more-output:~$ cat myflag
