# Challenge Name
Practicing Piping: Split piping stderr and stdout

## My solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{8ZB-bUnqMttRlfAca5piuy3I3Uk.QXxQDM2wCN3gjNzEzW}`

I first tried to use the syntax given in the explanation at pwn.college but despite trying around multiple time i couldn't get the final output that I had desired. Finally after asking GEMINI AI i realised the mistake i was making and that is we can't use piping in the form of `|` because it can only handle stdout and cannot merge/swap stderr well.
```bash
hacker@piping~split-piping-stderr-and-stdout:~$ /challenge/hack | 2>/challenge/the | >/challenge/planet
bash: /challenge/the: Permission denied
bash: /challenge/planet: Permission denied
You must redirect my standard error into '/challenge/the'!
hacker@piping~split-piping-stderr-and-stdout:~$ /challenge/hack > >(/challenge/planet) 2> >(/challenge/the)
Congratulations, you have learned a redirection technique that even experts 
struggle with! Here is your flag:
pwn.college{8ZB-bUnqMttRlfAca5piuy3I3Uk.QXxQDM2wCN3gjNzEzW}
```
