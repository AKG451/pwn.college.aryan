# Challenge Name
Practicing Piping: Writing to multiple programs

## My solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{8EGTLK2OvzUglXl88NreboT8tCL.QXwgDN1wCN3gjNzEzW}`

I first decided to just treat both the `/challenge/the` and `/challenge/planet` as normal files and tried to pass the output of `/challenge/hack` as input for the other two but unfortunately it showed permission denied.
```bash
hacker@piping~writing-to-multiple-programs:~$ /challenge/hack | tee /challenge/the > /challenge/planet
bash: /challenge/planet: Permission denied
```
Since it showed permission denied for `/challenge/planet` I decided to put `/challenge/planet` through the means of substituition but then it showed permission denied for `/challenge/the`
```bash
hacker@piping~writing-to-multiple-programs:~$ /challenge/hack | tee /challenge/the > >(/challenge/planet)
WARNING: it looks like you passed the path /challenge/the, instead of the 
substituted process, to tee. This will cause tee to try to write to the 
/challenge/the file, rather than have the shell launch the /challenge/the 
command and redirect tee's output to it.
/usr/bin/tee: /challenge/the: Permission denied
```
Since it showed `/challenge/the` as permission denied i decided to use substituition for this too and this time it worked.
```bash
hacker@piping~writing-to-multiple-programs:~$ /challenge/hack | tee >(/challenge/the) >(/challenge/planet)
This secret data must directly and simultaneously make it to /challenge/the and 
/challenge/planet. Don't try to copy-paste it; it changes too fast.

Congratulations, you have duplicated data into the input of two programs! Here 
is your flag:

## What I learned
I learnt how to use piping and use tee and substituition together to achieve different goals and objectives.
