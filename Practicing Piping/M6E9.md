# Challenge Name
Practicing Piping: Filtering with grep -v

## My solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{IPIR5t_U9CcDIsITNiIBmQcvkin.0FOxEzNxwCN3gjNzEzW}`

IN this question the `/challenge/run` command contained thousands of flag out of which only one was the real flag. One thing common with all the decoy/fake flags is that they contained the world `DECOY` somewhere in the fake flag. So I used grep's inverse match argument to filter out all the flags containg `DECOY` text.
```bash
hacker@piping~filtering-with-grep-v:~$ /challenge/run | grep -v DECOY
pwn.college{IPIR5t_U9CcDIsITNiIBmQcvkin.0FOxEzNxwCN3gjNzEzW}
```

## What I learned
I learnt how to use piping and use grep inverse match feature iwth it to filter all the unwanted outputs.
