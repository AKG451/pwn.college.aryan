# Challenge Name
Practicing Piping: piping process substituiion for input

## My solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{YKXt2ctq7WNp0hRWkXO7nlbnMr-.0lNwMDOxwCN3gjNzEzW}`

`<(command)` replaces the command output for it's file path basically substitution occurs hence when we use `diff <(command1) <(command2)` it compares the file output of the two commands and hence prints whatever is different. In our case one of these command contained just decoy flags while the other one contained the same decoy flags but one real flag hence taking their difference gave us the right flag 
```bash
hacker@piping~process-substitution-for-input:~$ diff <(/challenge/print_decoys) <(/challenge/print_decoys_and_flag)
39a40
> pwn.college{YKXt2ctq7WNp0hRWkXO7nlbnMr-.0lNwMDOxwCN3gjNzEzW}
```

## What I learned
I learnt how to substitute commands for their file path and use diff to compare their outputs
