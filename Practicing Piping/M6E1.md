# Challenge Name
Practicing Piping: Redirecting output

## My solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{YEUsT7V7O5Y1Gm4bFC-PtkKQYrZ.QX0YTN0wCN3gjNzEzW}`

I used the basic syntax taught in the pwn.college documentation and replace hi with PWN and asdf with COLLEGE to get the flag.
```bash
hacker@piping~redirecting-output:~$ echo PWN > COLLEGE
Correct! You successfully redirected 'PWN' to the file 'COLLEGE'! Here is your 
flag:
pwn.college{YEUsT7V7O5Y1Gm4bFC-PtkKQYrZ.QX0YTN0wCN3gjNzEzW}
```

## What I learned
I learnt how to redirect outputs to other files

## References
