# Challenge Name
Practicing Piping: Redirecting output

## My solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{Y3mqJaueYhISddEzpXN4b6BN_8D.QXwcTN0wCN3gjNzEzW}`

I first redirected the output of COLLEGE to PWN file and after that as the exercise had mentioned I redirected PWN file to the input of /challenge/run
```bash
hacker@piping~redirecting-input:~$ echo COLLEGE > PWN
hacker@piping~redirecting-input:~$ /challenge/run < PWN
Reading from standard input...
Correct! You have redirected the PWN file into my standard input, and I read 
the value 'COLLEGE' out of it!
Here is your flag:
pwn.college{Y3mqJaueYhISddEzpXN4b6BN_8D.QXwcTN0wCN3gjNzEzW}
```

## What I learned
I learnt how to redirect inputs to other files and commands.
