# Challenge Name
Practicing Piping: Duplicating piped datan with tee

## My solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{Aipt6WlfT0kjQL1IuDo_dF_Yrz2.QXxITO0wCN3gjNzEzW}`

I first ran `/challenge/pwn | tee /challenge/college` command since I thought this would guide me how to use the `/challenge/pwn` command but unfortunately I got an error so I reread the pwncollege guide and question trying to search for a clue but I couldn't get anything. Hence I took help of gemini ai to understand how this tee command works and also what to do in such questions.
```bash
hacker@piping~duplicating-piped-data-with-tee:~$ /challenge/pwn | tee /challenge/college
Processing...
You are trying to use 'tee' *instead* of /challenge/college. Use it *between* 
/challenge/pwn and /challenge/college!
You must pipe the output of /challenge/pwn into /challenge/college (or 'tee' 
for debugging).
```
Now after taking a guide from Gemini AI i understood that we have to create a 3 way piping since two way piping won't work cause it tells tee to write the output of `/challenge/pwn to /challenge/college` which is not what we want to do in this question. We have to redirect the output of `/challenge/pwn` to our terminal through the tee command this will allow us to see the process that is occuring and we can do this by using the command `tee /dev/tty` where `/dev/tty` basically represents our current terminal. After doing this we have redirect tee to `/challenge/college`.
```bash
hacker@piping~duplicating-piped-data-with-tee:~$ /challenge/pwn | tee /dev/tty | /challenge/college
Processing...
Usage: /challenge/pwn --secret [SECRET_ARG]

SECRET_ARG should be "Aipt6Wlf"
The input to 'college' does not contain the correct secret code! This code 
should be provided by the 'pwn' command. HINT: use 'tee' to intercept the 
output of 'pwn' and figure out what the code needs to be.
```
Now after running the correct command we get the info that for getting the flag we have to run `/challenge/pwn` along with `--secret [SECRET_ARG]` in this case `[SECRET_ARG]` is `Aipt6Wlf`. So I ran the final command and got the flag finally.
```bash
hacker@piping~duplicating-piped-data-with-tee:~$ /challenge/pwn --secret Aipt6Wlf | /challenge/college
Processing...
Correct! Passing secret value to /challenge/college...
Great job! Here is your flag:
pwn.college{Aipt6WlfT0kjQL1IuDo_dF_Yrz2.QXxITO0wCN3gjNzEzW}
```

## What I learned
I learnt how to use three way piping and use tee command to see through the process that goes through while running the commands.
