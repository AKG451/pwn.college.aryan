# Challenge Name
Practicing Piping: Named pipes

## My solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{8BxWmDNg9SFUjzOJ5SREEjRkNQ9.01MzMDOxwCN3gjNzEzW}`

I first in `terminal 1` made the fifo pipe using the `mkfifo` command after that i initiated the cat process since it will wait until the pipe in started from the other side. Then i opened `terminal 2` and ran the command connecting `/challenge/run` and hence cat read the content in it through piping and i got the final flag.
```bash
`TERMINAL 1`
hacker@piping~named-pipes:~$ mkfifo /tmp/flag_fifo
hacker@piping~named-pipes:~$ cat /tmp/flag_fifo
You've correctly redirected /challenge/run's stdout to a FIFO at 
/tmp/flag_fifo! Here is your flag:
pwn.college{8BxWmDNg9SFUjzOJ5SREEjRkNQ9.01MzMDOxwCN3gjNzEzW}
```
```bash
`TERMINAL 2`
hacker@piping~named-pipes:~$ /challenge/run > /tmp/flag_fifo
You're successfully redirecting /challenge/run to a FIFO at /tmp/flag_fifo! 
Bash will now try to open the FIFO for writing, to pass it as the stdout of 
/challenge/run. Recall that operations on FIFOs will *block* until both the 
read side and the write side is open, so /challenge/run will not actually be 
launched until you start reading from the FIFO!
```

## What I learned
I learnt how to create pipes and store it like files using `mkfifo` command.
